# Packaging Your Mod

> Check out this section for more details on the [Mod Packaging Interface](../toolkitinterface/remix-toolkitinterface-layouttab.md)

When you're ready to share your mod, it's time to package it.
This process ensures that all the necessary elements (like assets, textures, and sublayers) are present in your project directory.
If any references are missing, you'll see a dialog prompting you to fix the unresolved assets.
See the [Fixing Unresolved Assets section](../toolkitinterface/remix-toolkitinterface-layouttab.md#fixing-unresolved-assets) for more information on the dialog in question.

Once packaging is complete, click the "Open in Explorer" button to see your packaged mod directory.
You can easily zip up this directory, and it'll be ready for uploading and sharing.

Exciting upcoming features include RTX I/O.
